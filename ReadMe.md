## Mine Sweeper Project

This was a project that was done for my csci455 class at USC. The implementation is in java and you will have to be able to run the program within a desktop that allows for pop ups. 

<br/>

In order to run the program, compile all the files ending with .java:
```linux
javac *.java
```

<br/>

Afterwards, you will want to run the main program that allows for the game to be played.
```linux
java MineSweeper
```
